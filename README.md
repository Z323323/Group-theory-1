# Formal group theory

## Groups

<p>
  [https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/group/group.html].
  
  We define a group $G^{\ast}$ as a set $G$ and a binary operation $\cdot$ having the following properties:

  1. For all $x, y \in G, x \cdot y \in G$. This is normally referred to as 'algebraic closure'.
  2. There exist an identity element $1 \in G$ such that $x \cdot 1 = x$ for all $x \in G$.
  3. The operation defined $(\cdot)$ is associative, that is, for all $x, y, z \in G$ we have $x(yz) = (xy)z$.
  4. For all $x \in G$ there exists an element $x^{-1}$ with $xx^{-1} = x^{-1}x = 1$ (the inverse). I proved this property here [https://github.com/Z323323/From-Fermat-to-the-group-theory?tab=readme-ov-file#proof-of-existence-and-uniqueness-of-inverses-in-z_p-and-z_phinast]. Note also that the formal definition of group doesn't imply we have a _finite_ group and it's therefore more general. The linked proof is about _finite_ multiplicative groups, which are the main interest for computer scientists.

  - If only $1,3$ holds for $G^{*}$ then $G^{\ast}$ is a semi-group.
  - If only $1, 2, 3$ holds for $G^{*}$ then $G^{\ast}$ is a monoid.

  In general if you see $G^{\ast}$ around in papers this will refer to a multiplicative group.

  If $G^{\ast}$ is commutative then

  5. For all $x, y \in G, xy = yx$

  and we call it _abelian_.

  ### Axioms

  1. Closure (trivial).
  2. Associativity (trivial).
  3. Right and left cancellation:
     - $ax = bx$ iff $a = b$. This one is not that trivial if you think about _finite groups_ and therefore modular arithmetic [https://github.com/Z323323/From-Fermat-to-the-group-theory?tab=readme-ov-file#cancellation-law].
    
  ### Order

  The order of an element $g$ in a group $G$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $g^{k} = 1$. We know this exists for all elements of $Z_{\phi(n)}^{\ast}$ (_finite groups_), while it doesn't for all elements of _infinite groups_ (holds only for $1$, at my current perspective).

  ### Subsets

  A subset $H$ of $G$ which satisfy the previous properties is called a subgroup of $G^{*}$. Every _finite group_ has two improper subgroups which are defined by the subsets $\\{1\\}$, and $G$. All other subgroups are defined as proper subgroups.

  We can write $H \leq G$ to refer to any subgroup of $G^{*}$ and if $H \neq G$ then $H < G$.

## Homomorphism and isomorphism

<p>
  An homomorphism is a map $f : G &rarr H$ between two different groups where

  $f(x)f(y) = f(xy)$

  for all $x, y \in G$. If $f$ is bijective then $f$ is called $isomorphism$.

  Let's clarify this concept a little, since it looks really abstract, and it is indeed, and it's also really important in math.

  #### Example

  Imagine the _infinite group_ $G$ defined over the integers towards infinity and $G_n$ being a _finite group_ of order $n - 1$, we have

  $G = (\\{1, 2, \dots, \infty\\}, \times\\}$<br>
  $G_n = (\\{1, 2, \dots, n - 1}, \times\\}$

  We define the omomorphism $f : G &rarr G_n$ where $f(x) = x$, then we have

  $

  ## Some basic theorems collapsed

<p>
  
  ### 1

  If $g \in G$ has order $o$, then $x^{m} = 1$ iff $o | m$. This is a direct consequence of [https://github.com/Z323323/Group-theory-elements?tab=readme-ov-file#proof-of-cyclicness-of-subgroups-and-uniqueness-of-each-element].

  ### 2

  If $x \in G$ has order $mn$, where $m, n$ are coprime, then $x$ can be uniquely expressed in the form $x = uv$ where $u$ has order $m$ and $v$ has order $n$. This can be checked at [https://github.com/Z323323/Chinese-remainder-theorem?tab=readme-ov-file#example], but can be proved by choosing $a, b$ such that $am + bn = 1$ (Bezout's Identity) and picking $v = x^{am}$ and $u = x^{bn}$ such that $uv = x$.
